# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Implementation for Finance AI

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive RAG system implemented for the Finance AI application, providing context-aware financial advice for immigrants and gig workers.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **RAG Service** (`backend/services/ragService.js`)
   - Main service handling retrieval and generation
   - Manages vector store and embeddings
   - Provides context-aware financial advice

2. **Vector Store** (FAISS)
   - Stores financial knowledge embeddings
   - Enables semantic search for relevant context
   - Persists data in Azure Cosmos DB

3. **Financial Knowledge Base** (`backend/data/financialKnowledgeBase.js`)
   - Comprehensive financial advice database
   - Tailored for immigrants and gig workers
   - Categorized by visa type, work status, and financial topics

4. **AI Suggestions API** (`backend/api/aiSuggestions.js`)
   - RESTful endpoint for AI-powered financial advice
   - Integrates with user context and profile data
   - Supports both specific queries and contextual suggestions

5. **Knowledge Management API** (`backend/api/knowledgeManagement.js`)
   - CRUD operations for financial knowledge base
   - Allows dynamic updates to the knowledge base
   - Supports categorization and prioritization

## Features

### Context-Aware Advice
- **User Profile Integration**: Considers visa status, income type, region, and goals
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailors advice based on individual circumstances
- **Relevance Scoring**: Ranks suggestions by relevance to user context

### Financial Knowledge Categories
- **Credit Building**: Strategies for different visa types and work statuses
- **Tax Planning**: Specific guidance for gig workers, employees, and students
- **Emergency Funds**: Tailored recommendations for immigrants and freelancers
- **Investment Strategies**: Retirement planning and investment options
- **Banking Services**: Account recommendations and financial services
- **Home Buying**: Real estate guidance for different immigration statuses
- **Insurance**: Health, renters, and other insurance needs
- **Budgeting**: Expense management and financial planning
- **Debt Management**: Strategies for handling various types of debt
- **Visa Planning**: Financial preparation for visa transitions

### AI-Powered Features
- **Interactive Chat**: Real-time financial advice through chat interface
- **Goal-Based Suggestions**: AI recommendations for savings goals
- **Contextual Learning**: System learns from user interactions
- **Source Attribution**: Provides sources for all financial advice

## API Endpoints

### AI Suggestions
```
POST /api/aiSuggestions
{
  "userId": "string",
  "query": "string",
  "context": {
    "visaStatus": "H-1B",
    "incomeType": "gig",
    "region": "California"
  }
}
```

### Knowledge Management
```
GET /api/knowledgeManagement?category=credit&priority=high
POST /api/knowledgeManagement
PUT /api/knowledgeManagement
DELETE /api/knowledgeManagement?id=knowledge_id
```

### Enhanced Goals API
```
GET /api/goals?userId=user_id&includeSuggestions=true
POST /api/goals
```

## Frontend Integration

### AI Chat Screen
- Interactive chat interface for financial advice
- Quick question suggestions
- Source attribution and context display
- Real-time AI responses

### Enhanced Savings Goals
- AI-powered suggestions for goal achievement
- Contextual advice based on user profile
- Integration with RAG system for personalized recommendations

### Home Dashboard
- AI Advisor card for quick access
- Contextual suggestions based on user data
- Integration with existing financial tracking

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with:
```
COSMOS_DB_URI=your_cosmos_db_uri
COSMOS_DB_KEY=your_cosmos_db_key
COSMOS_DB_DATABASE=FinanceAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### 3. Database Setup
The system will automatically create the following containers in Cosmos DB:
- `financialKnowledge`: Stores financial advice embeddings
- `userProfiles`: User context and preferences
- `aiInteractions`: Chat history and learning data
- `userKnowledge`: User-specific financial knowledge

### 4. Initialize Knowledge Base
The RAG service will automatically initialize with the comprehensive financial knowledge base on first startup.

## Usage Examples

### Getting Financial Advice
```javascript
// Frontend usage
const response = await api.post('/aiSuggestions', {
  userId: user.id,
  query: 'How can I build credit as an H-1B worker?',
  context: {
    visaStatus: 'H-1B',
    incomeType: 'employee',
    region: 'California'
  }
});

console.log(response.data.advice);
```

### Adding Custom Knowledge
```javascript
// Admin usage
const response = await api.post('/knowledgeManagement', {
  content: 'New financial advice content...',
  metadata: {
    category: 'investing',
    priority: 'high',
    visa_type: 'H-1B'
  }
});
```
